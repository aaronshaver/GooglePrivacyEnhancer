Google Privacy Enhancer
=====================

Does it make you nervous that search engines can assemble a profile on you based on what you search for? Would you like for your search requests to be more private, to blend into the crowd a little more?

Google Privacy Enhancer is a solution to this problem. It will perform random searches in random intervals while you are logged into your Google account for as long as you let it run. This acts to "smoke bomb" or "fuzz" your search history, so that Google can't easily generate a profile on you.

This program is for educational and entertainment purposes only, and could be adapted for use with other sites, such as Amazon.com. (Have you ever noticed your Amazon search history influencing targeted ads on sites other than Amazon? I have!)

Installation and Usage
------------

1. Install Python 3.x on your machine: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Selenium for Python: `pip install selenium` (note that Python 3.4+ should include pip)
3. Install Firefox on your machine: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ (note that you can easily use other browsers such as Chrome; it's a one-line code change to use a different driver for Selenium)
4. Run the script from your commanndline: `script.py`
5. Let the script run for as long as you'd like. You could even have the script run at particular times of day (e.g. in the middle of your night) on a schedule if you don't want it interrupting you.
